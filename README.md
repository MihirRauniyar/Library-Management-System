--------------------------------------------- Workflow of the code ------------------------------------------------

A library's book information (stock) is kept in a text file (books.txt). The application 
reads the text file (books.txt) and shows all of the books that are available for
borrowing. Then, with each transaction (borrow/ return), a receipt is produced
for the specific borrower and saved in a txt file. Following each transaction, the stock
of books is updated.
The receipt created when someone borrows a book includes the borrower's name, the title of the book
borrowed, the date and time of issuance, and the total sum to be paid for the
borrowing. If a person wishes to borrow numerous books, all of the borrowed
volumes will be noted and the total sum is calculated.
When a book is returned to the library, a receipt should be generated and saved in
a txt file. The note will include the borrower's name, the title of the
book, and the date and time of return. 
The loan period should be set to 10 days, and if a person is late returning the book, 
a daily-basis fine is charged included in the receipt.
